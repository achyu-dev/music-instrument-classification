1.Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Music Classification by Keunwoo Choi et al. (ISMIR 2017) This paper introduces CRNN, a model that combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks for music classification tasks, including music instrument classification. It uses spectrogram representations and explores the temporal patterns in audio data.

2.Convolutional Neural Networks for Music Instrument Recognition by Han-Ting Chiang et al. (ISMIR 2014) This work explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for music instrument recognition. The authors experiment with different CNN architectures and spectrogram representations to achieve high accuracy.

3.Automatic Musical Instrument Recognition in Polyphonic Audio by Juan P. Bello et al. (IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 2005) While this paper is not focused on the AST model, it provides insights into using time-frequency representations (such as spectrograms) and machine learning techniques for automatic musical instrument recognition
